    </h3>
<p7>
    <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>

    Instructions
</h3>
<p8>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast.</li>
    <li>Cut the chilled butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or fork to incorporate the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
    <li>Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the cold water and milk. Stir until a rough dough forms.</li>
    <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Shape the dough into a ball, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until firm.</li>
    <li>Roll the chilled dough out into a rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick. Fold the dough into thirds, like a letter, and then roll it out again into a rectangle.</li>
    <li>Repeat the folding and rolling process two more times, chilling the dough for 30 minutes between each fold.</li>
    <li>After the final fold, roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick. Cut the dough into triangles.</li>
    <li>Roll each triangle up tightly, starting from the wide end, to form a croissant shape.</li>
    <li>Place the croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover them loosely with plastic wrap, and let them rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Brush the croissants with beaten egg and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown and flaky.</li>
    <li>Allow the croissants to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy your homemade croissants!</li>
