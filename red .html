        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together oil, buttermilk, eggs, food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract and beat until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Once the cakes are completely cool, frost the top of one cake layer with cream cheese frosting. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.</li>
        <li>Decorate the cake as desired, slice, and serve!</li>
