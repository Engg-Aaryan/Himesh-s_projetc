            Instructions:
        </h3>
        <p6>
            <li>Slit the green chilies lengthwise and remove the seeds. Keep them aside.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine mashed potatoes, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, chaat masala, and salt. Mix well to form a smooth filling.</li>

            <li>In another bowl, prepare the batter by mixing gram flour, turmeric powder, red chili powder, baking soda, salt, and enough water to form a smooth and thick batter. The batter should coat the back of a spoon well.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Dip each stuffed chili into the batter, ensuring it is well coated.</li>
            <li>Gently slide the coated chilies into the hot oil and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Remove the fried Mirchi Bajjis using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with green chutney or tomato ketchup.</li>
