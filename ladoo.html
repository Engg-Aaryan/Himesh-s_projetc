        Instructions

    <p6>
        <li>Heat ghee in a deep frying pan or kadhai over medium heat.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, add gram flour and slowly add water to make a smooth batter. The batter should be of pouring consistency.</li>
        <li>Using a perforated ladle or a special ladle with small holes (jhar), pour the batter over the ladle and allow tiny droplets to fall into the hot ghee. Fry until they turn golden brown. This forms the boondi.</li>
        <li>Drain the fried boondi on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, prepare sugar syrup by heating sugar and water until it reaches one-string consistency.</li>
        <li>Add cardamom powder to the sugar syrup and mix well.</li>
        <li>Combine the fried boondi with the sugar syrup and mix gently until well coated.</li>
        <li>Allow the mixture to cool slightly until you can handle it comfortably.</li>
        <li>Grease your hands with a little ghee and shape the mixture into round ladoos. Garnish each ladoo with assorted nuts.</li>
        <li>Let the Motichur Ladoos cool completely before storing them in an airtight container.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy these delicious sweets!</li>
