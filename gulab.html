        Instructions
    </h3>
    <p4>
        
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking powder. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add ghee or butter to the mixture and mix until it resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Gradually add milk and knead the mixture into a soft dough. Add more milk if needed. The dough should be smooth and soft.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small equal-sized balls and roll them between your palms to make smooth, crack-free balls.</li>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Gently slide the prepared balls into the hot oil and fry them on low to medium heat until they turn golden brown. Make sure to fry them evenly on all sides.</li>
        <li>While the jamuns are frying, prepare the sugar syrup by dissolving sugar in water over medium heat. Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using) to the syrup and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes until it slightly thickens.</li>
        <li>Once the jamuns are fried to a golden brown color, remove them from the oil and drain excess oil on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Transfer the fried jamuns to the warm sugar syrup and let them soak for at least 1-2 hours to absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Your Gulab Jamuns are now ready to be served! Enjoy them warm or chilled.</li>
