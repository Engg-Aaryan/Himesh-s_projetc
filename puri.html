        Ingredients:
    </h3>
    <p19>
        <li>3 cups whole wheat flour (360 grams)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oil (optional, for crispiness)</li>
        <li>Water (as needed)</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </p19>
    <h3 class="rr">Instructions:</h3>
    <p20>
        <li>1.Make The Dough</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together 3 cups whole wheat flour (360 grams), 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon oil (optional).</li>
        <li>Add just a bit of water at a time as you begin to form the dough, making sure not to oversaturate the mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Knead the dough until you form a stiff, tight dough. It should not be soft like a roti or a bread loaf. You can add about ¾ to 1 cup of water in total.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature.
         </li>
        <li>2.Form Puri:</li>
        <li>When ready to use, divide the dough into about 30 small or 25 medium pieces, and roll each into a tight ball.</li>
        <li>Lightly flatten the dough ball using the palm of your hand.</li>
        <li>Apply a bit of oil to the entire surface. This helps the bread fry evenly and rise properly without the need to dust with flour first.</li>
        <li>Roll the puri dough evenly into circles that aren’t too thick or too thin. Ideally, they should be about ¼ inch thick.</li>
        <li>3.Fry Puri:</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep pan or kadhai on medium-high flame.</li>
        <li>Gently place one puri in the oil,
            Press it lightly with a slotted spatula or spoon. It will immediately start to puff out.</li>
            <li>Flip the puri and fry until it becomes golden brown on both sides.
            </li>
